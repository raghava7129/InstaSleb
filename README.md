# InstaSleb

InstaSleb is an application designed to demonstrate the responsiveness of views across different screen sizes. It's built with a focus on responsive design, ensuring that the user interface adapts smoothly to various screen resolutions, from any mobile devices. A key feature of InstaSleb is its independence from the device's font size and display size settings, meaning that changes to these settings will not affect the application's layout and text sizes.

Please note that the code for the responsive design feature is currently commented out in the MainActivity.java file.

## Features

- **Font and Display Size Independence**: Changes to the device's font size or display size settings do not affect the application's layout and text sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience.
